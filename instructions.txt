Contacts Application:
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple app that interacts with an api and displays data in a usable fashion.

Requirements/Notes:

● UI should be simple but visually appealing and handle varied screen sizes. If you enjoy building a well styled interface this is an opportunity to show off
● API errors should be handled appropriately
● App should be built using React or React Native
● Please don’t use an opinionated boilerplate project (i.e. Create React App is fine since it doesn’t dictate the app structure)
● This is intended to be representative of how you would build a real project so architect the project as if it were going to be something you’d be maintaining long term and be submitting for code review:
○ Code clarity / formatting / comments
○ Testing strategy

○ Data architecture
API Endpoints
GET /contacts
UI Functionality: Display all contacts Phone numbers should be properly formatted in local format. Ability to filter contacts by name
Response: {contacts: [{ “name”: “Bob Barker”, “number”: “+15556789090”, “context”: “personal”}]}

Response:
{contact: { “name”: “Bob Barker”, “number”: “+15556789090”, “context”: “personal”}}
To present you with an api to build against you can run json-server using this db.json.

Misc/Other Notes
● Please provide a README with any instructions on how to run or compile your code
● While our main goal is to look at your code, we will run your code and test it.
● There is no timeline, please take as long as you want. However if you take especially long we may check in.
● If you have any questions please ask.
● Easter eggs are encouraged.
